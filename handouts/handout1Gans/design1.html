  <h1>Design 1 Handout</h1>
  <h3>The Macbook Pro as an Artifact:
  <h4>Duncan Gans </h4>
  
  <p> The macbook pro is a great example of an artifact that is focused on
design. Apple products are constantly lauded as being customer focused, detail
driven, and experience oriented. Furthermore, the Macbook Pro itself is full
of hundreds of affordances both while the computer is on, and before it is even
open. Because it is such a complex product I will only focus on the physical
hardware aspects that are accessible to the user. I will discuss the keyboard,
the buttons, the charger ports, but not discuss how the desktop looks, or the 
various apps available.
  </p>
  <b>Affordances</b>
  <p>
An affordance is a way that a user can interact with the product, in this case
the macbook. The laptop offers dozens of affordances but I'll focus on a few.
These include the ability to open the macbook, plug various items into the 
sides of the macbook, turn it on, use the mouse pad, and type on the keyboard. 
All of these are intentional features of the macbook that offer ways for the 
user to interact with the laptop.
  </p>
  <b>Signifiers</b>
  <p>
A signifier is a signal that communicates to the user an affordance. This can 
be visual, implicit in the design of the affordance, or more explicit. The 
macbook is full of these. The name itself, "macbook", is a signifier to indicate
that it is something that should be opened. If that isn't enough, there is a 
small indent that not only makes it easier to open the computer but also 
signals and invites a user to open it. The charger and headphone ports are also
full of signifiers that take the shape of small icons to the side of the ports
themeselves. Even the shape of the keyboard buttons invites you to click on
them. Furthermore, the power button, in addition to having a clear power icon
on it, is clearly separated from the rest of the keyboard in a way that 
signifies greater meaning. Finally, the trackpad invites you to use it and
slide your finger on it with it's shiny canvaslike surface. 
  </p>
  <b>Constraints</b>
  <p>
A constraint is a limiting factor of a product that reduces the sphere of
usability for the customer. There are a few of these on the macbook. The 
various ports on the side of the computer only allow the correct cord to fit
inside. The trackpad is indented in a way that clearly limits where you can use
it. All of the buttons, and the opening of the macbook have a clear limit to
the amount you can push them or open them.
  </p>
  <b>Feedback</b>
  <p>
Another important aspect of design is implementing feedback. Feedback is the
way a system notifies a user that the affordance is being used. With the 
macbook, this takes shape in a variety of ways. However, Apple does a good
job of ensuring that there isn't too much feedback with several of the 
affordances. One instance of feedback is the power button. As soon as the power
button is clicked, the screen lights up and begins a loading page. It is 
possible that things could load while the screen is not on, and the screen 
would only turn on once the setup is fully loaded, however it's important the
customer recieves immediate feedback. The same can be said for the opening of
the macbook triggering the turning on of the screen. However, there are 
instances where there is a lack of feedback, which in itself is important. 
Using a macbook would become very tedious if every time you clicked a key on
the keyboard a notification would pop up, or a sound would emit. The same can
be said for the trackpad. By using clear, and simple feedback without offering
feedback where it isn't needed, Apple takes advantage of the tool of feedback. 
  </p>
  <b>Mapping</b>
  <p>
Mapping involves distinguishing the relation between to sets of things. With
the macbook this is not super well defined. One example is the keyboard. The
keyboard is set up in a way that is clearly mapped to work with someone's 
fingers. The main keys are all about the size of a finger pad, and the ones on
the sides are a little larger, indicating that one's hands rest in the middle.
Furthermore, the name macbook implies an idea of mapping. In this case, the 
opening of the laptop indicates the beginning of the use of the laptop. This
comes from the familiarity of opening a book to read it.
  </p>
  <b>Concept Design</b>
  <p>
Finally, the macbook is a good example of an implementation of a concept model.
A concept model is a simplified description of how something works. In the case
of the macbook, the design of the macbook invites the user to test out the 
product with a simple learning curve. The more necessary, easy to understand, 
elements are on the main surface of the macbooks inside, whereas the more 
confusing ports are more hidden away. Therefore, although there isn't a clear
model being showed, the macbook makes it easy for the user to discover what
they need through experiementation.
