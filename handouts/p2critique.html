<h1> Project 2 Critique: Bo and Michelle</h1>
<h4> What's the web site you are critiquing, and the data it's exploring?</h4>
For this critique I looked at Bo and Michelle's visualization of the El Nino
dataset. This dataset dealed with various ocean related attributes across
the pacific ocean over a time scale of a few decades. Each instance is a 
specific location and a time. In addition to this information, various 
attribtues such as wind speed, surface temperature, subsurface temperature,
and humidity are tracked. The nature of the data lends itself to showing how
the attributes change over time, and/or by location. This is what was done.
One visualization shows how the values change over time, both day to day, and
month by month. Another visualization shows how these values are different
based on their location. 
<h3> Visualization 1: Heatmap </h3>
<h4> What are the specific goals of the visualization? </h4>
The purpose of the heatmap visualization is to show changes in specific 
attributes over time. With each box representing some time unit, whether a day
or a month, one can visualy see how different time units have different values
for the variables. 
<h4> What information is displayed, and what are the interactions? </h4>
Displayed on this graph are individual grid squares, each representing a 
specific day or month. Based on the positioning of the squares, one can infer 
the time, and based on the color, one can infer the actual value. There are 
several affordances on this visualization. The first is to change what attribute
to display. Here you can decide to measure subsurface temperature, humidity, or
air temperature. The visualization also affords switching the year, and whether
or not each grid is a day or a month. This lets you in theory zoom in and out
and swipe to focus on specific time areas. 
<h4> Is the visualization successful at achieving its goals? </h4>
For the most part, I'd say yes. If the goal of the visualization is to show
how various attributes change over time, this graph does do that. One can see
changes over time especially well by using the month by year tool. I think in
general a line graph is better at showing changes in time, with some exceptions.
However, when there is a lot of missing data, I can see the incentive for using
 a heatmap. By using a heatmap the missing data doesn't show up as a value of
 zero, but rather as an empty grid square. Still, the missing squares are far
 from ideal. However, although I think this visualization more or less does its
job. I think there could be a few alterations to more clearly answer questions.
One instance of this is the color scale. Although there is a wide enough range
in the colors on the scale below, in the vast majority of cases, the colors
only range from blue to light blue, instead of using the greens and yellows.
This makes it so it's harder to tell differences in similarly colored squares.
By emphasizing the differences more, it could make it easier to see changes. 
Furthermore, although I'm sure it could be somewhat difficult to do, the 
percentages used for the values don't clearly translate to real number values.
This abstracts away from the real world importance of the numbers. Finally,
although it's apparently fine in an older version of firefox, the lack of labels
makes it do less well with clarity and apprehension. It's not immediately clear
what each square represents, or what the positioning of the squares means. However
using the heat map is very efficient. By toggling to month by year, one can 
clearly see how the various attributes change month two month. The clumpings of 
certain colors very clearly display the appearance of seasonality. 
<h4> As you are interacting with the tool, are there questions you would 
     like to ask about the data, but can't? </h4>
I think the biggest question I find myself asking with this tool is what do
the actual colors represent in real numbers. Adding a small tool tip to each
grid square that when hovered over shows the actual temperature/percent humidity
would solve this well. 
<h3> Visualization 2: Chloropleth Map </h3>
<h4> What are the specific goals of the visualization? </h4>
For the Chloropleth map, it seems the goal is to show how the attributes 
gathered from various buoys are distributed across the pacific ocean. 
Furthermore, the graph also lets you see how these values change in the short
term, over a span of two weeks. 
<h4> What information is displayed, and what are the interactions? </h4>
This chloropleth does a great job of displaying useful information and offering
insightful affordances. The basic information displayed is the relative 
magnitude of various attributes tracked at each buoy. The size of the circle 
represents this relative magnitude. However, byond this, there are some useful
interactions that help give even more insight to the user. The first is the 
drop down menu for different attributes. Here you can choose which attribute you
want to focus on. Another valuable affordance is being able to click on a 
circle. In my opinion, this is the most helpful one. Unlike the heat map, this
affords the reader the ability to see the actual values of a circle. 
Furthermore, clicking on the circle gives the user information about all the 
attributes, not just the one currently being toggled. Finally, the visualization
affords the ability to slide through a series of 13 days. This gives information
on how volatile the values are (this is super helpful for comparing wind speed
and surface temperature). By making the most important information the most 
visible, while also allowing the opportunity to see less important information, 
the visualization is very efficient and comprehensive.
<h4> Is the visualization successful at achieving its goals? </h4>
Yes. If the goal is to see how various attributes vary by location, this 
visualization succeeds. The visualization does well on aprehension and clarity
in that the circle size clearly shows the magnitude of a value, and the location
of the circle represnets the location of the data. However, although it answers
questions relatively well, the circles are a somewhat bizarre choice. For one,
I typically think of circles as representing the existance of a specific event,
or object. Typically, I think of the mere existence of a circle as a data point
in itself. However, in this visualization, there are circles everywhere there 
is data tracked. I line with this, when there isn't a circle in a given location
I am unsure whether it means the value is really low, or there simply isn't data
for that area. Finally, I think the visual could show differences a little 
better by having a slightly more agressive color scale. Although there certainly
is a minor difference in the purple of big circles and small circles, I think
since the emphasis of the graph is differences in values, they can further 
emphasize this by using a color scale. On a related note, it could have been
cool to use the same color scale as in the heatmap. Not only would this more
clearly show differences, but it would also add to the consistency of the graphs
However, despite these minor qualms, this visualization is a success. It shows
the most important information most obviously, but also lets the user do some
interactive exploring to discover more information.
the visualization does a great job of 
<h4> As you are interacting with the tool, are there questions you would 
     like to ask about the data, but can't? </h4>
Not a ton of questions. I would like to know what the date ranges are for
the time series. Furthermore, It would be neat to see the data from various
time periods. This would make it possible to compare things year to year, 
instead of just over the span of a few days. However, as a whole, the 
visualization does a great job of answering lots of questions.
