<b>The Data Set: Forest Fires</b>
<br></br>
The data that I am looking at is information about a national park in portugal
specifically related to forest fires. The data is geographic, and details 
various attributes that are related to forest fires such as the temperature,
the precipitation, soil information, and most importantly, the amount an area
has been burned.  Many use this dataset to predict what causes forest fires,
and to predict where future forest fires will take place. The actual attributes
detailed are.

<ul>
  <li> X Coordinate: The location's x coordinate within the park</li>
  <li> Y Coordinate: The location's y coordinate within the park</li>
  <li> Month: The Month, January through December</li>
  <li> Day: Day of Week, Monday-Sunday</li>
  <li> FFMC: Fine Fuel Moisture Code: a numerical rating of the moisture 
	content of litter and other cured fine fuels </li>
  <li> DMC: Duff Moisture Code: the moisture content of loosely-compacted 
	organic layers of moderate depth.</li>
  <li> DC: Drought Code: indicator of moisture, content in deep, compact
	 organic layers</li>
  <li> ISI: Initial Spread Index: combines the FFMC and wind speed to 
	indicate the expected rate of fire spread </li>
  <li> Temp: Temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
  <li> RH: Relative Humidity of the specific area in %</li>
  <li> Wind: Wind Speed in Km/Hour</li>
  <li> Rain: The rain in the given area</li>
  <li> Area: The amount of area burned in the given location (in Hectares)</li>
</ul>
<b>Brainstorming: Questions we might want to answer</b>
<ul>
  <li> What is the typical size of forest fires?</li>
  <li> How are fires impacted by the season, is fall worse than other 
  seasons?</li>
  <li> Where are the fires most common in the park? </li>
  <li> How long does a fire last before it dissapears?</li>
  <li> How does the moisture content of the soil vary, and do all the levels 
  vary in the same way?</li>
  <li> Are fire rates impacted by visitors (are there more fires on weekends)?
  </li>
  <li> How does the temperature, precipitation, and humidity vary through the 
  national park?</li>
  <li> How are various factors correlated with fire rates?</li>
  <li> Are the variables that are conducive to the existence of a fire
  also conducive to the spread of a fire</li>
  <li> How does rain reduce the spread of a fire </li>
