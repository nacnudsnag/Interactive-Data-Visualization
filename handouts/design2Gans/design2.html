<h3> Interactive Data Visualization </h3>
The site I chose to analyze is FiveThirtyEight's election forecast for 2016. 
Although they may not have succeeded in predicting who would win, they 
certainly succeeded in making a clear, engaging, and informative visualization
of how they predict the race will turn out. Their goal was to accurately depict
how they predict the 2016 race will turn out. To do this they've employed a 
wide range of graphs, maps, visuals, and tables to beautifully show how 
november 8th should go down. Although there are countless attributes I could 
analyze I will focus on the core principles put forth by the ACCENT acronym.

<br></br>
<b> Apprehension </b>
Apprehension is the ease at which a user can decipher the relationship between
variables. On this page there are dozens of different variable relationships
that the visualization masters at FiveThirtyEight want to demonstrate. In 
pretty much all scenarios they do this effectively. The most important of these
is the election map. Here they outline a map of the United States with each 
state colored based on the chance it will go to Hillary Clinton or Donald 
Trump. Although it is clear the redder states have a higher chance of going
to the Republican Candidate, it also gives a key to the colorings. Clicking 
on each of the states takes you to the states specific polling, and shows 
the chance of the candidate winning that state alone.
<br></br>
<b> Clarity </b>
Clarity is the ability to distinguish all the elements of a graph. 
FiveThirtyEight does an ecellent job of this. Although they display an enormity
of information, they make it clear what the information means with little bits
of copy describing the meaning of the graphs. They also make the most important
simplest visualizations the forefront of the site. Although there are dozens of
alternate visualizations to look at, they make it so the easiest ones are the 
ones the user is first exposed to.
<br></br>
<b> Consistency </b>
Consistency is the ability to know what's going on in one graph based on 
previous graphs. This is done well because FiveThirtyEight uses the same colors
and ways of showing electoral chances with all of their graphs. They also 
have the later and more hidden graphs rely on previous graphs in a way that
represents a perfect learning curve.
<br></br>
<b> Efficiency </b>
Efficiency is the ability to convey complex information in as simple a way as
possible and as efficiently as possible. FiveThirtyEight has dozens of various
graphs and illustrations, however they make the most prominent ones the most
efficient. Although you can get a greater idea by exploring the site more, 
one can get a very accurate picture of how the election will look, very quickly
by looking at the first visualization on the page.
<br></br>
<b> Necessity</b>
A chart follows this metric if the graph being used is the best way to show
the data, and the graph is necessary. FiveThirtyEight mostly succeeds at this.
Some of the later charts they have might not be completely necessary, but they
do offer a unique picture of the election and the possible outcomes that is 
not offered by the more prominent necessary visualizations. By using both a 
general efficient and necessary visualization at the beginning, and backing it
up with more niche and slightly less necessary visualizations, FiveThirtyEight
yet again succeeds.
<br></br>
<b> Truthfulness </b>
For a visualization to be truthful, it must not mislead the user, or exagerate
the data in a way that is counter to the truth. FiveThirtyEight does a good
job of this by showing confidence intervals, being transparent about what
their data comes from, and ensuring the visualizations are in line with the
data being shown. 
<br></br>
<b> Closing Thoughts </b>
Although FiveThirtyEight may have not predicted the correct winner of the 2016
election, they certainly did a good job of showing what they knew. By using the
site, users can get an accurate and general glance at how the election will 
turn out, but also get a more specific, niche look at certain aspects of the 
election. The ability to cater to all levels of interest and knowledge 
demonstrates that FiveThirtyEight clearly knows what they're doing.
