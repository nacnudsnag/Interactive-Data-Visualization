Note: I have read/heard that for efficiency concerns, it's best to put the
Javascript at the end of the body, so that it if takes a long time to load,
it won't hold other things up. (The page will start displaying sooner.) I
have also heard that putting it there can lead to other issues that you have
to finagle in your code.

Efficiency is not the point of this class, so we will generally avoid the
headaches, put the JavaScript in the head and move on.

<form>
  <button type="button" onclick="changeSize()">DOUBLE FONT SIZE!</button>
  <button type="button" onclick="moveLeft()"> Move Left</button>
  <button type="button" onclick="moveRight()"> Move Right</button>
  <button type="button" onclick="myMove()"> Slide Right</button>
