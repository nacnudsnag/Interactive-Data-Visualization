  <p>This map gives us an idea of a single fire centric view of forest fires.
The idea is to see how forest fires change over time, and how they clump 
together. This also allows us to see how long a forest fire lasts. Using
this map, we can tell that forest fires aren't as permanent or consistent
as we might think they are. On any given day, the areas that there are
forest fires changes dramatically. Furthermore, it shows that although there
are certainly clumps in the california area, there are also clumps of forest
fires in the southeast as well as the dakota region. It also demonstrates that
areas where there are larger clumps of forest fires also typically have a few
big fires that are in the center of the clumpings. This is different than the
more sporadic fires. Typically the more sporadic fires are smaller and don't 
last as long.
